                <h1>Setting Up My VPS And Website</h1>
                <p>
                    The first thing I had to do, was to find a place to actually host my website. 
                    And that's by getting a VPS. With the high energy prices and my slow internet, I chose to get an unmanaged Linux VPS. 
                    Why an unmanaged Linux VPS? Because it's the cheapest, it's Linux, I have root access and I know how to use it. 
                    Unfortunally for me, it's only one core and 1 gigabyte of RAM (900 MB)</p>
                <p>
                    So, what to do now? We set up up certbot with Let's Encrypt, to enable SSL certification on my VPS and website. Aint 
                    no way I use standard un-encrypted http.
                    AIght, now with that out of the way, we will now install the apache2 package, since I use Ubuntu 20.04. WHy use that
                    version? Because that's the one that came with my vps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ez right? I guess yeah. But now the annoying part, to actually make the site. I chose to follow the 
                    <u><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Mother Fucking Website</a></u> philosophy. So I'll just use plain HTML5 
                    and CSS. It's a bit bothersome, but I don't mind learning new things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me an hour to center this div. This is going to be fun... Oh, and don't forget to include a humans.txt file in 
                    your root path of your website. If you use apache2, then the default root path is <code>/var/www/html/</code>
