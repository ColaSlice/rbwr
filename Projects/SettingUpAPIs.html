                <h1>Creating An API</h1>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of variables to consider when creating an API. You need to know what the type
                    of API it needs to be, what it will do, how it will do it, how to deploy it and where to deploy it.
                    Of cause, there is more to this, but this is just the basics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What my API should be is a rest API, it will return basic system usage of the system when called, it
                    will be made with Python Flask with the psutil package, it will be deployed with Gunicorn and it will
                    be deployd on my VPS. I want the API to only be accessible locally on the VPS. Meaning if you are trying
                    to call it from outside the VPS, nothing will happen. Only processes on the VPS can call it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To run the API, simply do <code>gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:9000 app:app</code>. The first command <code>gunicorn</code>
                    runs the program <code>gunicorn</code>. The argument <code>-b</code> tells gunicorn to not expose the IP and port to the 
                    outside of the network. The first part of the argument <code>127.0.0.1:9000</code> is the IP, the <code>:</code> is 
                    meant to tell where the IP ends and the port start. The second part <code>9000</code> is the port number for the 
                    API to use. The last agument <code>app:app</code> is to tell wich Python scripts to use. The script is called <code>app</code>,
                    and is of type <code>app</code>.
